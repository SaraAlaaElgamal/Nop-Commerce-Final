## Introduction

NopCommerce is free, and it is the most popular ASP.NET eCommerce platform. The first nopCommerce version was released in 2008. At that time there were no free and open-source shopping carts that would not impose the limitations on business processes and flow hence the essential goal for nopCommerce was to fix that.

## Features

- *Product attributes*: Create as many variations of attributes for your products as you need, such as size and color - each with its own SKU, price, weight, image and stock level. eCommerce store owners can add checkout attributes: text options to products for shoppers to fill in, such as initials for monogrammed products. The shoppers can also upload files, for example, for custom prints on shirts.
- *Product comparison*: Comparing products side by side removes the guesswork from your customers and facilitates their research, hence, improving the time spent on, and odds of, adding a product to the cart.
- *Stock management*: Our inventory management allows store owners to discern physical stock and available quantities. You can easily manage backorder and pre-order status for each product. Multiple warehouses, partial deliveries, and stock management by product attributes (such as color and size) are supported.
- *Product Pricing*: In nopCommerce, price tools go beyond simple price tag creation. Store owners can set different prices for different groups of their customers, hide prices for extra-valuable items, and make customers contact a sales team by enabling "call for price". nopCommerce also supports "enter your price" functionality for donations.
